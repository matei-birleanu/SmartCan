# ESP32-WROOM-32 with round 240x280 TFT using the SPI ST7789 interface controller

- Example project to setup the round 240x280 TFT screen connected to an ESP32-WROOM-32 using PlatformIO IDE for VSCode.
- The screen is using the SPI ST7789 interface controller, with a CS pin which is pulled down to ground.
- I'm using the bodmer/TFT_eSPI display driver library.
- The platformio.ini file has the screen size and pins set for this particular screen.
- No manual change is required inside the TFT_eSPI library user setup, to set the drivers or pin definitions.  All of the configuration is in the platformio.ini file.
